## Features üåü

- **FastAPI**: Leverage the power of FastAPI for building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Postgres**: Utilize PostgreSQL for a reliable and scalable database solution.
- **Minimal Setup**: Get started with a straightforward configuration.
- **Developer Friendly**: Focus on developer happiness with clear documentation and a clean codebase.

## Getting Started üèÅ

To get started with the Agent API, follow these steps to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HackerGCLASS/agent-api.git
   cd agent-api
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:

   Create a new PostgreSQL database and update the following variables in your `.env` file with your database credentials:

   ```
   DB_DRIVER=postgresql+psycopg
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASS=your_db_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=your_db_name
   ```

4. **Run the migrations**:

   (No migration scripts are included in this repository. Please create the necessary tables manually or add your own migration scripts if needed.)

5. **Start the server**:

   Run the FastAPI application with the command below:

   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage üíª

Once your server is running, you can access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to interact with the endpoints.

### Example Request

To interact with an agent, send a POST request to `/v1/agents/{agent_id}/runs` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, agent!",
  "stream": true,
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "user_id": "your_user_id",
  "session_id": "your_session_id"
}
```

Replace `{agent_id}` with one of: `web_agent`, `agno_assist`, or `finance_agent`.

### Example Response

If `stream` is true, you will receive a streaming response (text/event-stream). If `stream` is false, you will receive a JSON response:

```json
"Hello! How can I assist you today?"
```
